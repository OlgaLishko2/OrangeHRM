# OrangeHRM Test Automation Project
This repository contains automated test cases written for the **OrangeHRM** (Open Source edition) application.  
The goal of this project is to practice building a complete test automation framework from scratch, using industry-standard approaches and tools.
## Project Overview
The OrangeHRM platform is an open-source Human Resource Management system.  
For this project, I set up the testing environment entirely from zero and implemented automated test scenarios covering key user workflows.
